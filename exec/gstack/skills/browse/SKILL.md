# browse: QA Testing & Dogfooding

Persistent headless Chromium. First call auto-starts (~3s), then ~100ms per command.
State persists between calls (cookies, tabs, login sessions).

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
BROWSE_OUTPUT=$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/find-browse" 2>/dev/null)
B=$(echo "$BROWSE_OUTPUT" | head -1)
META=$(echo "$BROWSE_OUTPUT" | grep "^META:" || true)
if [ -n "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
  [ -n "$META" ] && echo "$META"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "gstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" && ./scripts/setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

If you see `META:UPDATE_AVAILABLE`:
1. Parse the JSON payload to get `current`, `latest`, and `command`.
2. Tell the user: "A gstack update is available (current: X, latest: Y). OK to update?"
3. **STOP and wait for approval.**
4. Run the command from the META payload.
5. Re-run the setup check above to get the updated binary path.

## IMPORTANT

- Use the compiled binary via Bash: `$B <command>`
- NEVER use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. They are slow and unreliable.
- Browser persists between calls — cookies, login sessions, and tabs carry over.
- Dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt) are auto-accepted by default — no browser lockup.

## Core QA Patterns

### 1. Verify a page loads correctly
```bash
$B goto https://yourapp.com
$B text                          # content loads?
$B console                       # JS errors?
$B network                       # failed requests?
$B is visible ".main-content"    # key elements present?
```

### 2. Test a user flow
```bash
$B goto https://app.com/login
$B snapshot -i                   # see all interactive elements
$B fill @e3 "user@test.com"
$B fill @e4 "password"
$B click @e5                     # submit
$B snapshot -D                   # diff: what changed after submit?
$B is visible ".dashboard"       # success state present?
```

### 3. Verify an action worked
```bash
$B snapshot                      # baseline
$B click @e3                     # do something
$B snapshot -D                   # unified diff shows exactly what changed
```

### 4. Visual evidence for bug reports
```bash
$B snapshot -i -a -o /tmp/annotated.png   # labeled screenshot
$B screenshot /tmp/bug.png                # plain screenshot
$B console                                # error log
```

### 5. Find all clickable elements (including non-ARIA)
```bash
$B snapshot -C                   # finds divs with cursor:pointer, onclick, tabindex
$B click @c1                     # interact with them
```

### 6. Assert element states
```bash
$B is visible ".modal"
$B is enabled "#submit-btn"
$B is disabled "#submit-btn"
$B is checked "#agree-checkbox"
$B is editable "#name-field"
$B is focused "#search-input"
$B js "document.body.textContent.includes('Success')"
```

### 7. Test responsive layouts
```bash
$B responsive /tmp/layout        # mobile + tablet + desktop screenshots
$B viewport 375x812              # or set specific viewport
$B screenshot /tmp/mobile.png
```

### 8. Test file uploads
```bash
$B upload "#file-input" /path/to/file.pdf
$B is visible ".upload-success"
```

### 9. Test dialogs
```bash
$B dialog-accept "yes"           # set up handler
$B click "#delete-button"        # trigger dialog
$B dialog                        # see what appeared
$B snapshot -D                   # verify deletion happened
```

### 10. Compare environments
```bash
$B diff https://staging.app.com https://prod.app.com
```

## Snapshot Flags

The snapshot is your primary tool for understanding and interacting with pages.

```
-i        Interactive elements only (buttons, links, inputs) with @e refs
-c        Compact (no empty structural nodes)
-d <N>    Limit depth
-s <sel>  Scope to CSS selector
-D        Diff against previous snapshot (what changed?)
-a        Annotated screenshot with ref labels
-o <path> Output path for screenshot
-C        Cursor-interactive elements (@c refs — divs with pointer, onclick)
```

Combine flags: `$B snapshot -i -a -C -o /tmp/annotated.png`

After snapshot, use @refs everywhere:
```bash
$B click @e3       $B fill @e4 "value"     $B hover @e1
$B html @e2        $B css @e5 "color"      $B attrs @e6
$B click @c1       # cursor-interactive ref (from -C)
```

Refs are invalidated on navigation — run `snapshot` again after `goto`.
